# NSNSSMM Templates

These templates are premade examples of working configurations for various applications.

Note that not all settings are used and you **WILL HAVE** to make changes to the paths and rename the files to `nsnssmm.json`.

Some templates are only features to add to existing templates, those are named "_\<feature\>.json"
